Hi! I’m a fourth-year student double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at HCM-UIT. Most of my past projects focused on replicating systems from scratch, including exploring how my two majors intersect. For example, I built a car-driving system controlled by hand gesture recognition, combining AI with real-world applications.

Now, I’m diving deep into NLP (Natural Language Processing). I’m excited to take on projects that explore new techniques and push boundaries in this space. I love learning and experimenting with cutting-edge ideas, and I’m eager to create something impactful with AI.
